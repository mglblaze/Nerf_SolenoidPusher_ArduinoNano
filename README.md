# Nerf_SolenoidPusher_ArduinoNano
Arduino nano code for a nerf blaster solenoid pusher

It's been a long time since I managed to get myself to program anything, but I made this fairly simple program for a nerf blaster mod project I'm working on. Should be relatively simple, but I'm sure some could point out places I could have coded it better or a couple of redundant lines, but I tried my best considering the extremely thick layer of rust I built up.
